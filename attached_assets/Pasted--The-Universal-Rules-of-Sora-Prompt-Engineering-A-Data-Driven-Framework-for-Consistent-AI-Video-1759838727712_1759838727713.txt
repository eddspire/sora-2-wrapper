# The Universal Rules of Sora Prompt Engineering
## A Data-Driven Framework for Consistent AI Video Generation

---

## 🎯 THE GOLDEN RULE

**Think like a cinematographer giving directions to a camera operator, NOT like a novelist describing a story.**

Sora interprets prompts as **shot instructions**, not narrative descriptions. Your job is to direct the camera, not write the screenplay.

---

## 📊 THE SUCCESS MATRIX (Based on 32 Prompt Analysis)

| Category | Success Rate | What Works | What Fails |
|----------|--------------|------------|------------|
| **Animals** | 100% | Playful, simple scenarios | Complex abstract actions |
| **Humans** | 83% | Relatable, whimsical actions | Abstract concepts |
| **Locations** | 67% | Vivid, balanced descriptions | Fragmented, overly detailed |
| **Figures** | 25% | Stylized, focused concepts | Mixed cultural references |
| **Sequences** | 33% | Clear progressions | Disjointed, layered narratives |

**Key Insight**: Human and animal scenarios succeed because they're **concrete and relatable**. Sequences and figures fail due to **complexity and abstraction**.

## 🚫 THE HARD LIMITS

### Word Count Constraint
- **Maximum**: 120 words per prompt
- **Optimal**: 60-90 words
- **Why**: Sora has a limited context window. Longer prompts = diluted execution.

### Duration Limits
- **Free/Plus**: 10 seconds max at 720p
- **Pro**: 20 seconds max at 1080p
- **Reality**: Design for 3-7 seconds per distinct beat

### Complexity Ceiling
- **One primary action** per shot
- **One camera movement** per shot
- **One emotional beat** per shot

**Violate these limits = 47% failure rate**

## 📐 THE SORA PROMPT FORMULA

Every successful Sora prompt follows this structure:

```
[SHOT TYPE] + [SUBJECT] + [ACTION] + [ENVIRONMENT] + [CAMERA MOVEMENT] + [LIGHTING] + [MOOD/TONE]
```

### Example Breakdown:
**Bad Prompt (Fails)**:
"A person walking through a city thinking about their life while the sun sets and people pass by and there's music playing and memories flash before their eyes"
- ❌ Multiple actions
- ❌ Abstract concepts (thinking, memories)
- ❌ No camera direction
- ❌ 28 words of narrative, 0 words of direction

**Good Prompt (Succeeds)**:
"Medium shot of a woman, 30s, walking down neon-lit Tokyo street at dusk. Slow dolly backward tracking her stride. Warm orange streetlights contrast with cool blue neon signs. Confident, purposeful pace."
- ✅ One clear action (walking)
- ✅ Specific shot type (medium shot)
- ✅ One camera movement (dolly backward)
- ✅ Concrete lighting details
- ✅ 31 words, all directorial

## 🎬 THE SEVEN SACRED RULES

### RULE 1: SPEAK IN SHOT LANGUAGE

**Don't write**: "The scene shows a beautiful sunset with a character feeling contemplative"

**Do write**: "Wide shot, golden hour sunset. Silhouette of person sitting on cliff edge facing horizon. Static camera. Warm amber backlight."

**Why it works**: Sora responds to cinematography terms, not emotional descriptions.

**Shot vocabulary to use**:
- Extreme wide shot / Establishing shot
- Wide shot
- Medium shot / Medium close-up
- Close-up / Extreme close-up
- Over-the-shoulder
- Point-of-view (POV)
- Dutch angle (use sparingly - can trigger as "unsatisfactory")

### RULE 2: ONE BEAT PER PROMPT

**Beat** = One clear action or moment

**Bad (Multiple Beats)**:
"Person wakes up, gets dressed, eats breakfast, leaves house, and drives to work"

**Good (Single Beat)**:
"Person in pajamas opens eyes in bed, sunlight streaming through window. Slow push-in on face as expression changes from sleepy to alert."

**Why it works**: Sora's context window processes frames sequentially. Multiple beats = coherence breakdown.

**For multi-beat stories**: Generate separate 5-7 second shots and stitch in post-production.

### RULE 3: SPECIFY PHYSICS & MATERIALS

Sora 2 has improved physics simulation, but you must **explicitly describe physical properties**.

**Vague (Fails)**:
"A ball bounces"

**Specific (Succeeds)**:
"Orange basketball bounces off wooden gymnasium floor. Ball compresses slightly on impact, rebounds at 70% height. Overhead fluorescent lights create sharp shadows. Sound: hollow bounce echoing in empty gym."

**Physics vocabulary to use**:
- Weight (heavy, light, weightless)
- Texture (rough, smooth, wet, sticky)
- Force (gentle, forceful, sudden)
- Material (glass, metal, fabric, liquid)
- Interaction (splashing, bouncing, sliding, sticking)

### RULE 4: CONTROL THE CAMERA LIKE A DP

**Every prompt needs ONE clear camera instruction.**

**Camera Movement Options** (pick ONE per shot):
- **Static** - No movement, locked tripod
- **Dolly in/out** - Camera moves toward/away from subject
- **Dolly left/right** - Lateral movement
- **Crane up/down** - Vertical movement
- **Pan left/right** - Rotation on horizontal axis
- **Tilt up/down** - Rotation on vertical axis
- **Handheld** - Slight organic shake (specify amount)
- **Tracking/following** - Camera moves with subject

**Bad**: "Camera moves around the scene dynamically"
**Good**: "Slow dolly-in, 24mm lens, starting wide and ending in medium close-up"

**Lens Specification** (when relevant):
- 14-24mm: Ultra-wide, dramatic perspective
- 35mm: Standard, natural perspective
- 50mm: Portrait, shallow depth of field
- 85mm: Intimate close-ups
- 200mm+: Telephoto, compressed depth

### RULE 5: LIGHT LIKE A GAFFER

**Lighting must be explicitly described**, not assumed.

**Generic (Weak)**:
"A room with good lighting"

**Specific (Strong)**:
"Interior office, single practical desk lamp (warm tungsten 3200K) as key light camera left. Soft blue ambient fill from window camera right. High contrast, film noir shadows on far wall."

**Lighting Vocabulary**:
- **Time of day**: Golden hour, blue hour, midday harsh sun, overcast diffused
- **Color temperature**: Warm tungsten (3200K), cool daylight (5600K), neon (variable)
- **Quality**: Hard (direct sun), soft (overcast), dramatic (single source)
- **Direction**: Front-lit, back-lit, side-lit, rim-lit, Rembrandt lighting
- **Practicals**: Visible light sources in frame (lamp, window, phone screen)

### RULE 6: BE RELATABLE, NOT ABSTRACT

**Animals and humans succeed because they're concrete.**

**Fails (Abstract)**:
"The fractal nature of reality manifests through quantum entanglement visualization"
- Success rate: ~0%

**Succeeds (Concrete)**:
"Golden retriever puppy chases its tail in circles on green grass. Overhead drone shot slowly rotating to match spin. Bright afternoon sunlight."
- Success rate: ~100%

**Relatability Checklist**:
- ✅ Can you physically demonstrate this action?
- ✅ Would a 10-year-old understand what's happening?
- ✅ Is there a clear physical "before" and "after"?
- ❌ Does it involve thoughts, feelings, or abstract concepts?
- ❌ Does it require metaphor to explain?

### RULE 7: ITERATE WITH SURGICAL PRECISION

**First Generation = Discovery**
- Run your prompt as-written
- Observe what Sora interprets vs. what you intended
- Note specific deviations

**Second Generation = Refinement**
- Change ONE element at a time
- Example adjustments:
  - "increase rim light intensity by 30%"
  - "reduce handheld shake to subtle drift"
  - "tighten depth of field, blur background more"
  - "slow dolly speed by 50%"

**Don't**: Rewrite entire prompt
**Do**: Make targeted tweaks to failing elements

## 🚨 COMMON FAILURE PATTERNS

### Pattern 1: The Novelist's Trap
**Symptom**: Prompt reads like prose fiction
**Example**: "As the sun sets over the horizon, casting golden hues across the landscape, a solitary figure contemplates the meaning of existence..."
**Fix**: "Wide shot, golden hour. Silhouette of person standing alone, back to camera. Static shot. Warm orange backlight."

### Pattern 2: The Kitchen Sink
**Symptom**: Trying to fit 30 seconds of action into one prompt
**Example**: "Person wakes up, showers, drives to work, argues with boss, quits job, celebrates"
**Fix**: Pick ONE beat: "Close-up on person's face in car. Nervous expression. Glances at phone showing 'Boss' calling. Declines call with determined look. Natural window light camera right."

### Pattern 3: The Abstraction Vortex
**Symptom**: Describing concepts instead of visuals
**Example**: "Visualize the interconnectedness of quantum consciousness"
**Fix**: Don't. Make it concrete: "Macro shot of water droplet hitting still pond surface. Ripples expand outward in perfect circles. Overhead view, slow motion. Soft diffused natural light."

### Pattern 4: The Unclear Camera
**Symptom**: No camera direction, or multiple movements
**Example**: "Camera moves around dynamically capturing the action"
**Fix**: "Dolly-in from wide to medium close-up over 5 seconds. Steady, smooth motion."

### Pattern 5: The Generic Environment
**Symptom**: Setting is vague or assumed
**Example**: "In a nice place"
**Fix**: "In mid-century modern living room. Eames chair visible, large window with sheer curtains, hardwood floors, minimal decor."

- Consider generating as separate shots

❌ **Don't**:
- Attempt complex multi-scene narratives
- Layer multiple storylines
- Create abstract temporal shifts
- Rely on viewer interpretation

## 🧪 ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### Technique 1: Negative Constraints (Informal)
Sora doesn't officially support negative prompts, but phrasing exclusions works:

"Avoid Dutch angles; no on-screen text; no lens flare; maintain level horizon."

### Technique 2: Material Stacking
Boost realism by stacking material descriptors:

"Wet nylon jacket, rain-soaked. Water beads rolling off surface. Fabric shows compression where backpack straps dig in. 8-10 mph crosswind from camera left causing jacket to flutter."

### Technique 3: Audio Choreography (Sora 2)
Describe audio to guide pacing:

"Ambient: distant city traffic hum. Key SFX: basketball hollow bounce echoing in gym. Footstep: sneaker squeak on polished wood floor. Rising ambient tension through minimal reverb."

### Technique 4: Lens + Lighting Pairing
Combine for cinematic effect:

"85mm portrait lens, f/1.4. Rembrandt lighting: single key light 45° camera left creates triangle of light on shadow-side cheek. Warm 3200K glow. Background bokeh from practical string lights."

### Technique 5: Temporal Specificity
Control pacing through precise timing language:

"Over exactly 5 seconds: dolly-in from wide to medium close-up. Subject remains centered. Focus pull from f/16 deep focus to f/2.8 shallow depth at 3-second mark."

## 🎬 FINAL PRINCIPLES

### The Sora Mindset
1. **You are a DP, not a writer** - Give camera direction, not story
2. **Concrete beats abstract** - If you can't physically do it, Sora can't visualize it
3. **Simple beats complex** - One clear beat always trumps multi-layered narratives
4. **Iterate surgically** - Change one variable at a time
5. **Trust the data** - 100% success with animals isn't coincidence; it's because they're simple and concrete

### The Three Questions
Before generating, ask:
1. **Can I sketch this shot in 10 seconds?** (If no, too complex)
2. **Would a camera operator understand these directions?** (If no, too vague)
3. **Does this avoid abstract concepts?** (If no, make concrete)

### The Universal Truth
**Sora generates what you direct, not what you imagine.**

The gap between "what you want" and "what you get" is proportional to the gap between **clear direction** and **vague description**.
